# Budget Impact Analysis of DMPA-SC Introduction in South Africa Over 4 Years

This models the budget impact of introducing DMPA-SC in South Africa over 4 years and tracks the cost and efficiency gain for users transitioning from DMPA-IM and NET-EN to the longer acting self injectable DMPSA-SC. The product costs are hypothetical and are solely for exploratory purposes. The model is based on the following assumptions:

The following elements can be manipulated to explore possible outcomes:
1. The initial number of users of DMPA-IM, NET-EN, and DMPA-SC at baseline (Default values are 1,701,061, 552,108, and 0 respectively).
2. The annualized cost of healthcare facility visits for a woman using DMPA-IM, NET-EN, and DMPA-SC (Default values are ZAR1,316, ZAR1,974, and ZAR658 respectively).
3. The annualized cost of the product for DMPA-IM, NET-EN, and DMPA-SC (Default values are ZAR63, ZAR144, and ZAR116 respectively).
4. The conversion rate of users from DMPA-IM and NET-EN to DMPA-SC for each year (Default values are Year 1: 15.8417599%, Year 2: 35%, Year 3: 50%, Year 4: 65% for DMPA-IM to DMPA-SC; Year 1: 25%, Year 2: 35%, Year 3: 50%, Year 4: 65% for NET-EN to DMPA-SC).
5. Optionally, the user can specify the population size in each year to override the conversions.
6. Optionally, the user can specify the color of each cost element in the plot.

The model will produce a stacked bar plot showing the cost of healthcare facility visits, product costs, and the total cost for each year over the 4 year period and the efficiency gain for switching to DMPA-SC each year. The app will also produce a data table showing the number of users of each intervention, the cost of healthcare facility visits, product costs, and the total cost for each year over the 4 year period and the efficiency gain for switching to DMPA-SC each year.

The model is based on the following assumptions:
